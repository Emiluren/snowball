# To play the game first start a web server in public/. For example using python3:

cd public
python3 -m http.server

# Make sure you have the python websockets library:

sudo pip3 install websockets

# Go into pyserver and start the actual game server:

cp pyserver
python3 main.py

# Now that the server is running you can open the address of the web server you started
# in a web browser (for the python web server above this would be http://localhost:8000)

# Have fun :)
